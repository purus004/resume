            <h2 class="section-title">Techniques</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <h3>1. Soil Preparation</h3>
                <p>The foundation of any successful floriculture project is good soil preparation. The soil must be rich in nutrients and well-drained. Techniques such as adding organic compost, using pH-adjusting agents, and ensuring proper irrigation systems are key.</p>

                <h3>2. Crop Selection</h3>
                <p>Choosing the right flowers for the local climate and market demand is essential. Common flowers in commercial floriculture include roses, lilies, and orchids. The integrated approach focuses on selecting varieties that are disease-resistant and high-yielding.</p>

                <h3>3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>
                <p>Using biological and chemical methods to manage pests is essential for maintaining healthy crops. Integrated pest management includes using natural predators, resistant crop varieties, and eco-friendly pesticides to ensure a balanced ecosystem.</p>

                <h3>4. Modern Technologies</h3>
                <p>The use of automation, greenhouse systems, drip irrigation, and temperature-controlled environments helps improve production efficiency and quality. Technology has revolutionized floriculture, enabling year-round production.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The integrated development of commercial floriculture is crucial for the sustainability and profitability of the flower industry. By using modern agricultural techniques, managing pests responsibly, and adopting new technologies, floriculturists can increase productivity, reduce costs, and meet the growing demand for flowers both locally and globally.</p>
                <p>As we move towards a more integrated approach, it is important to continuously research and adopt practices that help in improving floricultureâ€™s economic and environmental impact.</p>
